I grew up in Richardson, came to UT in 2005 for college and never quite left. Did the iMPA program to get a masters in Accounting because it was easy enough, even though I think that career is aggressively disinteresting. Gave me plenty of time to keep up with side pursuits in music and design though, and run events for several student organizations through college though, most noticeably Planet Longhorn for international and exchange students. I don't use my degree for jacksquat but it helped a lot to know Excel.</p> 


<p>Worked at a retail website one summer for a terrible boss but learned a lot because I ran his whole business for him. Nabbed an Online Analyst internship dealing mostly with SEM and data manipulation after graduation at TOMS Shoes but moved back here because SoCal is expensive. Started working in the International department at Indeed - currently in charge of Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. It's a very open-ended role, though over time I've drifted towards teaching myself programming and machine learning to make analysis faster and smarter, with a side of SEO. Basically, I try to pull meaning out of numbers, and make tools so others can too.</p>


<p>I'm really really really into music, SXSW, and food. I'm also into industrial, graphic, and web design and imagining I can still snowboard and surf, though a recent trip proved the latter is now untrue. Don't ever say you're bored around me because I will force you to learn something - with the internet you never have an excuse to be bored." - James Chiang</p>
